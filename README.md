# Airplane Data Analytics Repository

This repository contains dbt models, LookML views, and explores for analyzing airplane data, including usage metrics, specifications, and revenue analysis.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to transform raw airplane data into analysis-ready tables and visualizations. We aim to facilitate insights into airplane utilization, specifications, and revenue generation by different airplane models and manufacturers.

### Key Models

1. **Staging Models**: Normalize raw data and handle JSON and Excel sources.
2. **Mart Models**: Aggregate data for usage, revenue, and specifications.
3. **LookML**: Define views and explores to visualize airplane metrics in Looker.

### Project Structure

- **models/staging**: Contains staging models for transforming raw JSON and Excel files into a clean, usable format.
- **models/marts**: Aggregated models for data marts. Each mart model is designed to provide specific insights and KPIs.
- **LookML Example**: LookML view files for defining fields and measures in Looker. Also LookML explore files for joining related views and creating analysis-ready data structures.

### Key Features

- **Partitioned and Modular Design**: Each model is modular, using separate CTEs to handle different stages of transformation. This ensures scalability and ease of debugging.
- **Descriptive LookML Documentation**: Dimensions and measures are documented to provide context and assist end-users in understanding the fields.
- **Source Integrity**: Defined tests for source data to maintain data quality, including `dbt-expectations` for enhanced validation.


# Marts Models: Purpose Summary

This document provides a brief overview of the purpose of each mart model.

### 1. `airplane_usage`
**Purpose**: Aggregates airplane usage data, focusing on key metrics like the number of trips completed and revenue generated by each airplane model. Useful for analyzing airplane utilization and revenue contribution by model.

### 2. `airplane_specifications_summary`
**Purpose**: Summarizes specifications across airplane models by manufacturer, providing average metrics on seat capacity, weight, and range. Enables high-level comparisons between manufacturers' typical airplane capabilities.

### 3. `trip_analytics`
**Purpose**: Aggregates trip data to provide insights into demand, revenue generation, and average trip duration. Ideal for understanding popular routes, trip profitability, and operational optimization.

### 4. `customer_insights`
**Purpose**: Aggregates customer data, including total orders, spending, and group information. Supports customer segmentation and profiling for marketing, loyalty programs, and customer relationship management.
